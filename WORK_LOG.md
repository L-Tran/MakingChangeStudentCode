| January 21 |    1:25:-1:45pm     |                                We started to brainstorm in class after Mr. Blick explained the problem set to us. We had many ideas. I thought of using a Trie to store all the possible routes and treat the coins like possible paths. Lucas also explained his "frog" problem where there is hypothetical distance a frog has to go and it can take coin step jumps. They solutions however will not work because in both, the order matters, but for our coins, it is just a collection of coins without a specific order. Towards the end of class we started to realize that this problem would require use of memoization and finding the sub-structures of the problem |
| January 21 |      5:20-6pm       | I did a lot of hard braining storming of what the sub-problem for this problem set is and I came up with a guess. I think that the sub-problem is finding the number of ways for each different coin, and adding as more coins are added. To represent this, I chose to use an array the size of each coin. However, I am not sure yet how I will implement this so that I can update the number of coins efficiently, but I know that I will use the previous number in the array to find the next number of coins with the new coin added. I think a base case in a recursive method may be how I use the array which I will add the element to the current number of moves. |

However I made some changes. Instead of adding each coin along the way, I decided the make my ways array hold the number of ways depend on the target value. My code is meant to go from 1 to the target value and my ways array would store each # of ways along the way to make it more efficient. I thought I did everything correct, but I realized a fatal flaw. My code accounts for permutation because of the way the recursion is set up, a likely source of my failing of the test cases. I know I need it to be combination. |
| January 26 |     10-10:30am      |                                                                                                                       After diagnosing the problem that my code spit out permutation instead of combination amount of coins, I did some research on how to change this. I watched a video on how to recursively code combination. It was a pretty clear video, but the one difference it had was that the total would not always add up to target. I tried my best to implement in but it still did not give successful results, but it was a little closer. I hope Mr. Blick teaches this problem with memoization because I still think that should be the correct solution. |

I was so close on my attempt! I did the worksheet understand the call stack better for the memoization. Then, I looked at the slides, specifically the pseudo code for the recursive method because that is where I was most confused. After that it was easy to implement I just had to adjust my 2d array to be log to avoid overflowing. |
