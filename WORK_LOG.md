| January 21 | 1:25:-1:45pm |                                We started to brainstorm in class after Mr. Blick explained the problem set to us. We had many ideas. I thought of using a Trie to store all the possible routes and treat the coins like possible paths. Lucas also explained his "frog" problem where there is hypothetical distance a frog has to go and it can take coin step jumps. They solutions however will not work because in both, the order matters, but for our coins, it is just a collection of coins without a specific order. Towards the end of class we started to realize that this problem would require use of memoization and finding the sub-structures of the problem |
| January 21 |   5:20-6pm   | I did a lot of hard braining storming of what the sub-problem for this problem set is and I came up with a guess. I think that the sub-problem is finding the number of ways for each different coin, and adding as more coins are added. To represent this, I chose to use an array the size of each coin. However, I am not sure yet how I will implement this so that I can update the number of coins efficiently, but I know that I will use the previous number in the array to find the next number of coins with the new coin added. I think a base case in a recursive method may be how I use the array which I will add the element to the current number of moves. |
